# Amazon-Fine-Foods-Analysis
The objective of the analysis was for a given review to determine whether the review is positive or negative.
It was a binary classification problem. Used effective algorithms such as K-NN and Naive Bayes to classify a
given review. Performed data optimization tasks such as data mining, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
review text preprocessing using pandas, sqlite3 and numpy. Utilization of NLP techniques such as BOW, TFIDF,
Word2Vec to convert text data to vectors. Applied cross validation to split the vector data into train and 
test data sets and also used cross validation to obtain the best value of K and Alpha on the metric of accuracy
score. Finally tested the data with the model developed on the most recent reviews using both KNN and Naive Bayes
model.
